# Faster Development of CodeIgniter 3.x/2.x Apps

That's Bonfire's goal: provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications.
It's not a CMS.
Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build.

All wrapped up in an elegant interface that will make you proud when you hand the project over to your client.

Thanks to the Bonfire team for a great release. This version uses MongoDB as the default backend. Doctrine ODM is the primary DB Driver.
